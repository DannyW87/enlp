							<h1>How to get involved</h1>
							<p>There are a number of ways to get involved in the project.</p>

							<h4>Get involved in the project advisory group</h4>

							<p>The project will be guided by academics with expertise in the area. We also wish to include members of the local community from a range of backgrounds as advisors. This will involve attending two informal meetings over the 3-year project period, where the group will help refine the research tools and discuss the implications of the research findings.  The role provides the opportunity for local people to help shape research which aims to improve experiences of marketing and nightlife local and nationally. We are keen to involve individuals aged 18-35 from ethnic minority and LGBTQ+ communities in particular.</p>
							<p>If you would like to know more about this role, please contact <a href="mailto:a.m.atkinson@ljmu.ac.uk">Dr Amanda Atkinson</a></p>

All participants will receive amazon vouchers to show our appreciation for their valuable involvement in the research.</p>
							<p>Those taking part in the discussions will also be invited to get involved in an arts-based workshop and exhibition, which aims to disseminate the research findings to a public audience and key stakeholders.</p>
							<p>We will be recruiting people to take part through local colleges and universities, community groups, work places and social media. If you are aged over 18 and would like to know more about taking part in the group discussions, please contact <a href="contact.html">Dr Amanda Atkinson</a></p>

							<p>We will be conducting interviews with individuals working within alcohol brand and venue marketing and promotion, to gain insight into the creative process, the changing nature of marketing and diversity in marketing, cause marketing and social responsibility, and experiences of working within regulatory codes.</p>
							<p>Interviews will last around 1 hour and are likely to take place on LJMU premise or a location preferred by the participant. All discussions will be confidential and anonymous, and you and your organisation will not be named in any of the publications.</p>
							<p>You will also be invited to the project report launch, which aims to bring key stakeholders together to debate the research findings.</p>
